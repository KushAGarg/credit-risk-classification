# credit-risk-classification

Python and logistic regression were used to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.

The Credit_Risk folder contains the main Jupyter Notebook script and a Resources folder containing the CSV file. Examples from other GitHub repositories were used to help develop the script.
